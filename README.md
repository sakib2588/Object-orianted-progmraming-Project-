Introduction
The PC Component Store Management System is designed to streamline the process of
managing and selling PC components efficiently. This system primarily caters to
administrators and staff members, allowing them to handle inventory, manage stock, and
facilitate sales transactions seamlessly. Administrators have control over adding and
removing products, managing staff accounts, and overseeing stock levels, ensuring smooth
operations. Staff members can sign in, view available products, update product details, and
process sales transactions.
With this platform, the store can maintain an organized inventory, track stock changes, and
ensure accurate sales management. The system provides an intuitive interface for staff to
manage daily operations effectively, ensuring a smooth workflow. By digitizing the
management process, the PC Component Store Management System enhances efficiency,
minimizes errors, and ensures a well-organized approach to selling PC components.
